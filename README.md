sns-sqs-test
============

A simple program to test usage of sns-sqs linkage to send and receive messages

Most of the code currently comes from https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=232617

I may tidy it up one day.

To run it, add a file named awsCredentials.properties into src/main/resources containing 'accessKey' and 'secretKey'.
